## Promoting a brand aesthetic

As an open-source project with a growing number of collaborators, the Rosé Pine team wanted a simple, consistent way to create beautiful social images for our projects. This project was born from that goal.

### ...using existing tools

The image generator was forked from Vercel's [Open Graph Image as a Service](https://github.com/vercel/og-image). It uses headless Chromium to render an HTML page with the chosen theme & text, then takes a screenshot and provides it for download.

I was able to explore the codebase and modify the project to fit our team's branding and needs. I added multiple themed backgrounds and allowed the user to enter the name of their project.
